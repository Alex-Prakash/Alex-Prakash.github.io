You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

## Typography Test

This is a paragraph to test the typography. It should have a comfortable line length and line height.

> This is a blockquote. It should stand out from the rest of the text.

### Code Example

Here is some Python code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

And here is some lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem A
  - Subitem B
